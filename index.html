<br>
<body>This is my little hobby website. I am slowly withdrawing from social media sites in favour of something 'hand-rolled'. The following anecdote will hopefully explain why my site is a bit...how do you say it...shit...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>My first car was a Vauxhall Chevette. It was green, with a sunroof, and smelled a bit damp inside.<br>

<br>One day, the alternator died, and so I had to get my hands dirty to replace it. I'm not a skilled mechanic; it's fair to say I'm below average, maybe even an un-skilled mechanic. So I talked it through with my Grandad (Jack) who knew about these things. He explained what I needed to do to get the alternator out of the engine. With the help of a sketch, on the back of an envelope, he described what I needed to do to take it apart and clean the bushes (or is it brushes?). He explained how to re-assemble and re-install. It all sounded a bit fiddly.
<br>So I talked to my Dad, who immediately said... "You don't take alternators apart anymore, they are sealed units... take it out, and go and get a new one".
<br>And that is what I did.
<br><br>I finished the job, and reported back to Grandad. He obviously didn't want to criticise my early attempts at engineering, but he couldn't help observe that...<strong> "If you can't take it apart, how are you supposed to understand how it works?"</strong>.
<br>
<br>Which is why, in a roundabout kind of way, I decided to construct my little presence on the web as much by hand as I can. No WordPress.
